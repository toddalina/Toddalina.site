This is an experiment on creating and storing files for a website on github. All of the files that I have personally created are open source, (don't know which license yet). I do currently have some files from jquery ui located in the directory css/, but hopefully most of these will disappear over time.

I figure, why not have you website code available for others to use and see. ;) Some stuff that needs to be more secure and not readable will have to be stored elsewhere, but I guess that that is ok.
